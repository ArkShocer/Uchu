# Uchu Helper Scripts
Helper scripts used to help in the development of Uchu.
If you are looking for the scripts that run in the game,
see [Uchu.StandardScripts](../Uchu.StandardScripts).

See the [docs](../docs) directory for specifics on using
the scripts.

## Setup
The scripts rely on Python 3 with some additional libraries.
With Python installed, the libraries can be installed with
the following:
```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`python3` may need to be replaced with just `python` depending
on your setup.
